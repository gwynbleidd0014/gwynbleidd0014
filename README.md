ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Ucha, a backend developer with experience in .NET technologies. I specialize in crafting robust solutions using ASP.NET Core Web API, MVC, Entity Framework, and SQL Server.

ðŸš€ With a solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, I thrive on building efficient and scalable applications that meet business needs.

ðŸ”§ My journey in .NET has been exciting, and I'm continuously expanding my skills and knowledge. I'm particularly interested in diving deeper into advanced topics and best practices within the .NET ecosystem.

ðŸ’¡ I'm open to collaboration opportunities and always eager to connect with fellow developers to exchange ideas and learn from each other's experiences.
